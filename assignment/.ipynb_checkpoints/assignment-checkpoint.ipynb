    "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
    "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
    "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
    "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
    "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
    "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
    "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
    "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?"
